I am a research scientist at Yahoo working on the [DataSketches](https://datasketches.apache.org/) team.
My research interests are in randomised algorithms for large-scale data analysis and machine learning, as well as fundamental matrix computations.
During summer 2020 I was research intern at Verizon Media (now Yahoo) in the 
DataSketches team where I focused on regression model training using matrix summaries.
In 2019 I was an Applied Science intern at Amazon's Cambridge Laboratory and 
developed scalable streaming algorithms for principled anomaly detection.

Between 2016-2021, I was a PhD student at the University of Warwick's Department of Computer Science, supervised by 
[Graham Cormode](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/).
My [PhD](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/161585/) won the Faculty of Science, Engineering and Medicine Thesis Prize in Computer Science.
In August and September 2018 I was a visiting graduate student at the Simons
Institute for the Foundations of Data Science program.
From September 2017 - August 2018, I was an Enrichment Year Student at the [Alan Turing Institute for
Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) where I studied how large-scale regression problems
can be solved more quickly using sparse random projections.
Prior to starting my PhD at Warwick, I completed my MSci
in Mathematics at the University of Birmingham.
